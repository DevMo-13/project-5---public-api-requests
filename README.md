 Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Project 5 - Public API Requests

This project builds an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other. This app uses the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for random “employees,” and uses that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. This directory has 12 employees listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
