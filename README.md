Key achievements:
- Requested a JSON object from the public API (Random User Generator API) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and used that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory
- Parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location
- Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address
- Added a way to toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open
- Enabled search functionality that filters the directory by name
