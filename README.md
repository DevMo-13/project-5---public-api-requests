# PUBLIC API REQUESTS
 Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Project 5 - Public API Requests

For this project, I built an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and used that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. This directory has employees listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

Key achievements:
- I requested a JSON object from the public API
- I parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location
- Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address
- I added a way to toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open
- I added search functionality that filters the directory by name
